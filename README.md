# District_Health_Analytics_SQL

Health Services Data of Koraput's Sub-districts

- The dataset includes information about the types of health care facilities and the services used in Koraput's Sub-districts during January 2021. I got this data directly from the official government website of Odisha.

- The SQL queries I used in this analysis give us important insights that are really helpful for managing healthcare and making decisions in Koraput.

P.S.: I'm from Koraput District in Odisha, so this project has a special place in my heart. Working on this project taught me a lot about the healthcare services provided by different facilities in Koraput and showered me with meaningful perspectives.
