# District_Health_Analytics_SQL

Health Services Data of Koraput's Sub-districts

My primary aim was to understand the dynamics of healthcare facilities and service utilisation throughout the month of January in 2021-22. The series of SQL queries in this analysis collectively yields substantial insights that holds significant relevance for Healthcare Management and Decision-making within the boundaries of the Koraput district.

P.S.: I am from Koraput District of Odisha, so this project holds special place in my heart. The experience of working on this project has broadened my understanding of the Health Care Services provided by the different facilities in Koraput and gave me unexpected dimensions of knowledge and insights that have enriched my perspective.
